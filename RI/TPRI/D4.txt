I think it rattled the old man a bit, and stimulated him, not to fear, but to
anger. For he suddenly dropped my hand and instead gripped me by the
back of my coat and swung me forward, like a whelp offered to a
prospective new owner. “I’ve brought the boy to you,” he said in a rusty
voice.
And when the house guard continued to stare at him, without judgment
or even curiosity, he elaborated. “I’ve fed him at my table for six years,
and never a word from his father, never a coin, never a visit, though my
daughter gives me to understand he knows he fathered a bastard on her. I’ll
not feed him any longer, nor break my back at a plow to keep clothes on
his back. Let him be fed by him what got him. I’ve enough to tend to of
my own, what with my woman getting on in years, and this one’s mother
to keep and feed. For not a man will have her now, not a man, not with this
pup running at her heels. So you take him, and give him to his father.” And
he let go of me so suddenly that I sprawled to the stone doorstep at the
guard’s feet. I scrabbled to a sitting position, not much hurt that I recall,
and looked up to see what would happen next between the two men.
The guard looked down at me, lips pursed slightly, not in judgment but
merely considering how to classify me. “Whose get?” he asked, and his
tone was not one of curiosity, but only that of a man who asks for more
specific information on a situation, in order to report well to a superior.
