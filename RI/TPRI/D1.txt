And of the first real King, little more than his name and some extravagant
legends remain. Taker his name was, quite simply, and perhaps with that
naming began the tradition that daughters and sons of his lineage would be
given names that would shape their lives and beings. Folk beliefs claim
that such names were sealed to the newborn babes by magic, and that these
royal offspring were incapable of betraying the virtues whose names they
bore. Passed through fire and plunged through salt water and offered to the
winds of the air; thus were names sealed to these chosen children. So we
are told. A pretty fancy, and perhaps once there was such a ritual, but
history shows us this was not always sufficient to bind a child to the virtue
that named it. . . . My pen falters, then falls from my knuckly grip, leaving
a worm’s trail of ink across Fedwren’s paper. I have spoiled another leaf of
the fine stuff, in what I suspect is a futile endeavor. I wonder if I can write
this history, or if on every page there will be some sneaking show of a
bitterness I thought long dead. I think myself cured of all spite, but when I
touch pen to paper, the hurt of a boy bleeds out with the sea-spawned ink,
until I suspect each carefully formed black letter scabs over some ancient
scarlet wound.
