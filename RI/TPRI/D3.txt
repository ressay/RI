Almost, it is like a puppet show beginning. Yes, I can see it thus. The
curtains parted, and there we stood before that great door. The old man
lifted the brass knocker and banged it down, once, twice, thrice on the
plate that resounded to his pounding. And then, from offstage, a voice
sounded. Not from within the doors, but from behind us, back the way we
had come. “Father, please,” the woman’s voice begged. I turned to look at
her, but it had begun to snow again, a lacy veil that clung to eyelashes and
coat sleeves. I can’t recall that I saw anyone. Certainly, I did not struggle
to break free of the old man’s grip on my hand, nor did I call out, “Mother,
Mother.” Instead I stood, a spectator, and heard the sound of boots within
the keep, and the unfastening of the door hasp within.
One last time she called. I can still hear the words perfectly, the
desperation in a voice that now would sound young to my ears. “Father,
please, I beg you!” A tremor shook the hand that gripped mine, but
whether of anger or some other emotion, I shall never know. As swift as a
black crow seizes a bit of dropped bread, the old man stooped and
snatched up a frozen chunk of dirty ice. Wordlessly he flung it, with great
force and fury, and I cowered where I stood. I do not recall a cry, nor the
sound of struck flesh. What I do remember is how the doors swung
outward, so that the old man had to step hastily back, dragging me with
him.
