My memories reach back to when I was six years old. Before that, there
is nothing, only a blank gulf no exercise of my mind has ever been able to
pierce. Prior to that day at Moonseye, there is nothing. But on that day
they suddenly begin, with a brightness and detail that overwhelms me.
Sometimes it seems too complete, and I wonder if it is truly mine. Am I
recalling it from my own mind, or from dozens of retellings by legions of
kitchen maids and ranks of scullions and herds of stable boys as they
explained my presence to each other? Perhaps I have heard the story so
many times, from so many sources, that I now recall it as an actual
memory of my own. Is the detail the result of a six-year-oldâ€™s open
absorption of all that goes on around him? Or could the completeness of
the memory be the bright overlay of the Skill, and the later drugs a man
takes to control his addiction to it, the drugs that bring on pains and
cravings of their own? The last is most possible. Perhaps it is even
probable. One hopes it is not the case.
